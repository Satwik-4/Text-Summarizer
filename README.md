## Introduction

Extractive text summarization is a technique employed to produce a concise summary containing the most critical information from a lengthy document. It aims to facilitate comprehension and absorption of information, particularly from complex or extensive documents. This approach is widely used in journalism, business, and research to quickly summarize large volumes of data.

The primary goal of this project is to develop an extractive text summarization model using natural language processing techniques. We utilize Python and the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library for text preprocessing and summary generation. A diverse dataset of articles on various topics is used to assess the model's performance.

## Features

- **Text Summarization Algorithm**: We have developed a text summarization algorithm capable of generating concise and informative summaries from input text.

- **NLP Techniques**: The algorithm leverages techniques such as tokenization, word frequency calculation, sentence scoring, and the selection of top sentences to generate summaries.

- **Python and NLP Libraries**: The algorithm is implemented using Python and popular NLP libraries like NLTK and NumPy.

- **Evaluation and Validation**: Through the evaluation of the generated summaries and comparison with the original text, we have observed that the algorithm is capable of producing coherent and relevant summaries for a wide range of text inputs.
